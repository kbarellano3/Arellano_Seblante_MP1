# Quine McCluskey Algorithm App

Welcome to the Quine-McCluskey Algorithm App! This JavaFX application was made and designed by **Joy Arellano** and **Sheianne Seblante**. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for utilizing the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to solve and output the corresponding boolean expression given minterms and don't cares.

## Sample Input
- Minterms: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15
- Don't Cares: 2, 3
- Starting Variable: J

***Note**: The default starting variable is A*

## Expected Output
The simplified boolean expression should be:
**K'M + J'KM' + JK' + LM**

***Note**: The program has the ability to deploy multiple solutions for a group of minterms and don't cares*

## Installing the program
1. Download the source code from this [link](https://github.com/kbarellano3/Arellano_Seblante_MP1)
2. Open the downloaded source code in a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse


   ***Tip**: Before running the application in your IDE, ensure that your IDE is configured to use a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK). Most IDEs come bundled with a JDK or provide an option to download and configure one during installation.*
3. Compile the code and run the application
